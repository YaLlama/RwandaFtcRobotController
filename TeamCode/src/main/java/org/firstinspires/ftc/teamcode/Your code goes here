Welcome to the FIRST Tech Challenge(FTC)!

Right click on the folder this file belongs to and hover over "New" to create new files:

You can either select "Java Class" at the top, or navigate lower to "Package" to create folders to organize your code

Code in FTC is separated into two main categories:
    Classes
    OpModes

OpMode is FTC's specific way of labeling the code that will run.
In order to create an OpMode, when you create a new class, you must then type "extends SimplifiedOpMode"
 after where it says "public class [your class name]"
It will then require that you implement two methods:
    setup - this code will run once when the init button is pressed
    mainLoop - this code will loop while the play button is pressed, and the stop button isnt

Classes are documents of code you will write to stay organized
Classes will contain Functions you will create - functions are pieces of code that return an output when given input information
Classes and Functions themselves don't execute unless you tell them to - you run them by calling them in the OpMode
Essentially the purpose of Classes and Functions is to remove repeated code, so rather than copy pasting code,
you can reference a shortcut that you have created

You will find examples in the examples folder on how to do the things mentioned above, as well as sample code
of useful built-in functions in the FTC SDK (Software Development Kit)
